# This is the official list of people who have spent time on code review Pull Requests on the Gitea repository.
# This document should be reviewed and approved by owners.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure
# that people submitting code are listed in this file (by email address).
#
# The agreement for individuals can be filled out on the web.
#

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
